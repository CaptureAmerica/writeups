<p>I passed the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">OSCP</a> (Offensive Security Certified Professional) Exam at the first attempt.</p>
<p>I would like to thank my family, my manager and company I work with for the support.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In this blog, I&rsquo;m going to write something useful (I think) for OSCP exam takers.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="my-pc-setup">My PC setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Macbook Air (16GB RAM)</strong>
<br />
Previously, I was mainly using Kali on Windows 8 with VirtualBox. I thought the Windows 8 machine wasn&rsquo;t powerful enough for the OSCP exam, so I decided to buy a new PC. I bought a Macbook Air (16GB RAM).
<br /><br />
Since then, I&rsquo;ve been using Mac as a main PC and Kali as a sub PC. I launch OpenVPN &amp; Burp Suite on Kali (sometimes I also run Wireshark for troubleshooting), then I ssh into Kali from Mac PC using <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>, or FireFox pointing to Kali as a proxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VirtualBox</strong>
<br />
VMWare Fusion is recommended by Offsec. Just in September, <a href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal">VMWare Fusion 12 Free version</a> was released, so I tried it. But I decided to use VirtualBox since I had one Kali image I&rsquo;ve been using for CTF for some time. I didn&rsquo;t have any trouble with VirtualBox for the OSCP lab and the exam.
<br /><br />
By the way, the username on Kali is &ldquo;captureamerica&rdquo;. I used the user for the OSCP lab report and the exam. (So, the name appears in the report).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emacs</strong>
<br />
I&rsquo;ve been using Emacs editor for a long time. Here I also used Emacs for taking notes and for the OSCP reports. The output of <a href="https://github.com/M4ximuss/Powerless/blob/master/Powerless.bat">Powerless.bat</a> has no color, so I used Emacs to highlight some keywords. I&rsquo;ll write the details below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LibreOffice</strong>
<br />
For my own cheatsheet, I used LibreOffice.
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two External Monitors</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Standing Desk</strong>
<br />
During the OSCP exam, I kept standing up for almost 21 hours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="tips">TIPS</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid software version up</strong>
<br />
I suggest not to update any software or host OS as much as possible until the exam is over. Actually, I once updated VirtualBox, then I faced an issue where Kali was unable to boot up. Luckily, I could fix it soon (it was something related to the audio setting). MacOS Big Sur was released just before my exam, but I just ignored it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RDP</strong>
<br />
When accessing lab machines via RDP, I used SSH Tunnel through Kali as follows so that I could use Microsoft Remote Desktop on Mac. File copy is much easier by doing this.
<br /><br />
<code>$ ssh captureamerica@kali -L 13389:IPADDR:3389</code>
<br /><br />
<img src="https://captureamerica.github.io/writeups/img/OSCP_RDP.png" alt="OSCP_RDP.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlighting text with Emacs</strong>
<br />
I googled and anyhow I defined some regex in .emacs as follows. Initially, I added some definitions for <a href="https://github.com/M4ximuss/Powerless/blob/master/Powerless.bat">Powerless.bat</a>, then later on I added some for the output of gobuster, nmap, etc.
<br />
<img src="https://captureamerica.github.io/writeups/img/OSCP_Emacs.png" alt="OSCP_Emacs.png">
<br /><br />
Opening <a href="https://github.com/M4ximuss/Powerless/blob/master/Powerless.bat">Powerless.bat</a> output with Emacs: (btw, I modified Powerless.bat itself to log commands that it runs.)
<br />
<img src="https://captureamerica.github.io/writeups/img/OSCP_Emacs_Powerless.png" alt="OSCP_Emacs_Powerless.png">
<br />
(This output was taken on <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3">Metasploitable3</a>, not OSCP machine)
<br /><br />
Opening nmap output with Emacs:
<br />
<img src="https://captureamerica.github.io/writeups/img/OSCP_Emacs_nmap.png" alt="OSCP_Emacs_nmap.png">
<br />
(This output was taken on <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3">Metasploitable3</a>, not OSCP machine)
<br /><br />
Without color, it&rsquo;s not very easy to find key parts and in fact I have missed some during enumerations, so I think this is important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add the self IP to the IME dictionary</strong>
<br />
For some commands, the self IP address is often used, so I added it to the Japanese Input dictionary to save some time.
<br />
<img src="https://captureamerica.github.io/writeups/img/OSCP_IME.png" alt="OSCP_IME.png">
<br />
(This is not the IP address used for OSCP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy &amp; Paste commands</strong>
<br />
I collected all the commands I often use in one text file. When I started working on a new machine, I used the text file and replaced &ldquo;IPADDR&rdquo; &ldquo;MYADDR&rdquo; using Emacs or sed command, then most of the time, I just copy &amp; paste those commands.
<br />
This is useful to prevent typo and to save time.
<br />
<img src="https://captureamerica.github.io/writeups/img/OSCP_ToDo.png" alt="OSCP_ToDo.png">
<br /><br />
(One negative part is, it&rsquo;s difficult to memorize commands if relying on this too much.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!--
- **ツールのカスタマイズ**
<br />
[Powerless.bat](https://github.com/M4ximuss/Powerless/blob/master/Powerless.bat)とLinEnum.shは、自分で実行したいコマンドを追加したり、コマンドの順番を入れ替えたり、自分用に使いやすいようにカスタマイズしました。
<br /><br />
あと、WebアプリでLFI、SQL Injection、Command Injectionを見つけるツールを自作して使ったりもしました。あんまり活躍しなかったけど。。
-->
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="writing-reports">Writing Reports</h2>
<p>I used this Mark Down type of report.
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/noraj/OSCP-Exam-Report-Template-Markdown">https://github.com/noraj/OSCP-Exam-Report-Template-Markdown</a></p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reports can be written by using Emacs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light and smooth (I haven&rsquo;t tried writing a report that has more than 300 pages using LibreOffice, but I guess it becomes sluggish.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After converting to PDF, the contents sometimes look different (This might be the same when using Office software.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coloring of the code part isn&rsquo;t nice (I fixed this using an application. See below.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tools-i-used">Tools I used</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://typora.io/">typora</a>
<br />
I edited the .md file using Emacs and checked the design on Typora simultaneously. Though the PDF content looked different from the display of Typora, it&rsquo;s still useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pdf.wondershare.co.jp/">PDF Element</a>
<br />
I bought this application to fix the color of the code part.
<br />
Firstly, I used &ldquo;HTML&rdquo; for the code part (for instance, even if the code is &ldquo;Python&rdquo;, I specify &ldquo;HTML&rdquo;) so that it contains less color. After converting it to PDF, I changed the color using this tool.
<br />
Not only colors, but also I added/deleted some texts using PDF Element.
<br />
I also tried other PDF tools (e.g. Preview.app on Mac, Adobe Acrobat DC, Google Doc Plugin, etc), but as far as I tested, PDF Element was the best among them for this purpose.
<br /><br />
It&rsquo;s just like this,
<br />
When setting &ldquo;bash&rdquo; for the code: (not so nice, is it?)
<br />
<img src="https://captureamerica.github.io/writeups/img/OSCP_bash.png" alt="OSCP_bash.png">
<br /><br />
After the modification by using PDF Element:
<br />

<br />

</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="lab-report">Lab Report</h2>
<p>A lot of time is required for the Exercise. So, skipping the Lab Report is one of the options, but in my opinion it&rsquo;s good to spend some time to complete the lab report.
<br /><br />
The reasons are,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5 points are added to the exam points</strong>
<br />
It&rsquo;s just 5 points but I think it&rsquo;s important how soon we can reach 70 points during the exam. The more we take time, the more we feel nervous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Good practice for the exam report</strong>
<br />
You may be very tired on the 2nd day and the time is limited. (Actually, I was very exhausted on the 2nd day.) It&rsquo;s good to get used to writing reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise itself is meaningful</strong>
<br />
I sometimes referred to the Exercise report I wrote during the course, like, &ldquo;ah, I remember I did the same during the exercise!&rdquo; kind of thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CPE 40 points are given</strong>
<br />
I just found this out after the exam.
<br />
FYI. Here&rsquo;s how to submit CPE.
<br /><br />

</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="the-skillset-i-had-before-taking-the-oscp-course">The skillset I had before taking the OSCP course.</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.giac.org/certification/penetration-tester-gpen">GPEN</a></strong>
<br />
Got this 3 years ago. It was about to expire in Dec 2020. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I wanted to get OSCP. Sometimes, I referred to the notes I took during SANS training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.isc2.org/">CISSP</a></strong>
<br />
Got this about 6 years ago. In 2020, I did <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">HTB</a> to earn CPEs. I thought the 6 hours exam of CISSP was quite long but it&rsquo;s much shorter compared to the OSCP exam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-2-overview">LPIC-2</a></strong>
<br />
I got Level 1 &amp; 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pentest</strong>
<br />
I&rsquo;m working in a cyber security related IT company but my job is not related to Pentest. I used to play <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">HTB</a> but I stopped about 6 months ago after I earned enough CPEs to maintain CISSP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programming</strong>
<br />
I was working as a developer a long time ago and at that time I was using C language.
<br />
I&rsquo;ve been playing CTF for one and a half years and learned some Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>English</strong>
<br />
I&rsquo;m Japanese but I&rsquo;ve been living in an English-speaking country for about 15 years. OSCP manual, video, forum, and most of the information for OSCP found on the internet are all in English, so it&rsquo;s good to have English skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Windows</strong>
<br />
I know how to use Windows, but I wasn&rsquo;t very familiar with the commands, PowerShell, Active Directory. I had a little knowledge at the beginning of the OSCP course.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="how-i-spent-3-months">How I spent 3 months</h2>
<p>This is just FYI. The way I did might not be the best.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The first month</strong>
<br />
I began with the lab. I just tried to get as many as proof.txt. I planned to review all the machines later on anyway.
<br />
When I was stuck on a machine, I went to the forum right away to find the answer. Within a month, I finished Public (except for a few) and DEV network. I simply enjoyed the first month.
<br />
I also kept playing the video over and over while I was working on the lab machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The second month</strong>
<br />
I finished all the exercises and lab report for 13 machines within 3 weeks. Then I reviewed all the Public machines and DEV network. I read some books (One is all about Mimikatz. Another one is &ldquo;The Hacker Playbook 3 (Author: Peter Kim)&rdquo;. Both are written in Japanese), and I watched <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> (&ldquo;Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course&rdquo;).
<br />
I felt tired doing exercises but I tried harder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The third month</strong>
<br />
I did the rest of the lab machines within 10 days. Lab was completed.
<br />
For the rest of the days, I worked on <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3">Metasploitable3</a>, HTB &amp; VulnHub machines in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0">list</a>. Honestly, I lost confidence since I could not solve those HTB &amp; VulnHub machines without looking at the walkthrough.
<br />
OSCP exam was on Monday. I looked through the walkthrough documents of all the HTB &amp; Vulnhub machines (in the list above) that I could not try. I didn&rsquo;t have enough time, so I had no choice.
<br />
On Sunday, I did one <a href="https://github.com/freddiebarrsmith/Buffer-Overflow-Exploit-Development-Practice">BOF</a>.
<br />
<br />
Before the exam, I could not sleep well, maybe because I was too nervous.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="exam">Exam</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proctor setup (45 min)</strong>
<br />
It was supposed to finish in 15 min but it took 45 min.
<br /><br />
If you live in a different country from the passport issued country, another ID is necessary. So I suggest preparing it beforehand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BOF (50 min、25 points)</strong>
<br />
Most people begin with BOF. I just followed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine A (45 min、20 points)</strong>
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine B (3 hours、10 points)</strong>
<br />
Reluctantly, I had to use Metasploit..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine C (7 hours、20 points)</strong>
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine D (6 hours、25 points)</strong>
<br />
<br />
I spent 21 hours (including the break time and the final review time) to complete the exam.
<br />
<strong>I really tried harder.</strong>
<br /><br />
Here&rsquo;s the timeline. The exam began at 7:00, then I reached 70 points (this includes the 5 points of the lab report) at 18:00. After I reached 70, I asked the proctor, &ldquo;Am I allowed to play music?&rdquo;, then I got &ldquo;Yes, you may&rdquo;, so started playing Spotify. I sang songs and worked on the machines as usual.
<br /><br />
I ended the exam at 4:00.</p>

<p><strong>Exam Report</strong>
<br />
I took a nap and started working on the report. I spent roughly 4 hours. It contained about 40 pages.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Result</strong>
<br />
I got the result on the next day. I was glad to get the result so quickly because I was nervous after I sent the Exam reports.

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Throughout the OSCP course, I learned lots of stuff and I enjoyed so much. It was a very meaningful precious time. I still have a lot of things I do not know, so I will continue to study harder.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing is to enjoy studying. Actually, I&rsquo;m not planning to become a pentester. I intentionally try to enjoy it like doing CTF.</p>
<p>For the past 3 months, I stopped watching NetFlix, playing games, and I was very focused on OSCP, but I didn&rsquo;t feel much stress.</p>
<p>The OSCP manual, video, lab and exam are all well made and organized, I think it&rsquo;s worth paying for the course.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To: OSCP exam takers,</p>
<p><strong>Please enjoy and TRY HARDER!!</strong></p>
